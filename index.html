                    <li>
                        Vehicle-To-Vehicle (V2V) Communication For Collision Avoidance:
                        Undergrad Final Year Project
                        Focuses on providing SAE Level 1 driver assistance system to the
                        driver on the road. Through V2V communication the driver gets Front
                        Collision Warning (FCW) alerts and intersection assist about other
                        vehicles crossing the junction.
                        Implemented Wi-Fi based communication.
                        Used TCP for message communication between vehicles.
                        Fetched sensor data (Speed, Distance, GPS) through UART interface.
                        Designed algorithm by fusing this data together to
